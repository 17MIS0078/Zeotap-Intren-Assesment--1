Rule Engine Application
Overview
This is a 3-tier rule engine application designed to determine user eligibility based on attributes like age, department, income, and experience. The application uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent and evaluate conditional rules, allowing for dynamic creation, combination, and modification of rules.

Features
Dynamic Rule Creation: Users can define custom rules using a simple syntax.
AST Representation: Rules are stored as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for efficient evaluation and manipulation.
Eligibility Evaluation: The engine evaluates a userâ€™s eligibility based on predefined rules and their corresponding attributes.
Web Interface: A user-friendly interface for inputting rules, user data, and receiving evaluation results.
Tech Stack
Backend: Python (Flask)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Data Structure: Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
